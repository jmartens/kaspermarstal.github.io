description: This is a project I did for DTU Compute on the Hear-EU project (http://www.hear-eu.eu/). In this work, microCT images are registered to obtain correspondences for construction of statistical shape models of inner-ear anatomy. Today, standard CT images are used during surgical planning but these are of low resolution compared to the size of cochlea and contain a significant amount of noise. Model-based statistical understanding of shape variability from microCT images can be used to enhance the avialable anatomical information for surgical planning.
