description: This is a project I did for DTU Compute on the [Hear-EU project](http://www.hear-eu.eu/). In this work microCT images are registered to obtain correspondences that are well suited for construction of statistical shape models of inner-ear anatomy. Cochlear implants significantly improves quality of
life for hearing impaired patients but today standard CT images of the head are used during surgical planning where low-resolution and large amounts of noise limit the amount of available anatomical information. A model-based statistical understanding of the shape variability of the middle and inner ear among patients obtained here will be of great benefit during surgical planning.
