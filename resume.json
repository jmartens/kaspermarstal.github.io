    "summary": "I believe computer-based analysis of medical images and clinical data will change the future of modern healthcare and I'm absolutely thrilled to be working in this field. As a graduate in engineering I come with an open mind, new ideas and high standards for myself and the company I work for. My main interest is improving clinical workflow using computer aided diagnosis. I strongly believe in AI-based image analysis and making the oh-so-sophisticated algorithms user-friendly so the (often not so technical) clinical personnel can actually put them to good use.\n\nFor my Master's in Medicin & Technology, I specialized in machine learning and medical image processing. Being part medicine and part computer science, this degree provides a fantastic multi-disciplinary foundation for working in this field. I also have a bachelor degree in physics which has taught me the principles of problem solving and mathematical modelling. I have international experience and practical understanding of client contact through my 10 years working at Frederiksberg Hospital, first as a project assistant and later doing fulltime R&D. I am easy to work with and contribute to a relaxed but focused workplace.\n\nThe tools I develop help doctors improve patient's quality of life. THAT is motivation.\n\nI currently hold the position of Scientific Project Officer at Image Analysis Ltd in London, England. My responsibilities include developing the core image processing algorithms for Image Analysis' cloud-based MRI scoring platform, supporting clinical clients and keeping our servers up and running.
